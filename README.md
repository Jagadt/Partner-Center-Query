# Partner Center Query
Microsoft Cloud Solution Providers can manage customer accounts, place orders, manage subscriptions, and handle support requests through 
[Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com). All these operations can be performed programatically through the use of the 
[Partner Center API](https://apidocs.microsoft.com/services/partnercenter). Having the ability to visualize the data available from the 
Partner Center API can prove to be extremely benefical. This sample project demonstrates how to construct a [data connector](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/data-connectors-developer-preview/) 
that securely communicates with the Partner Center API. 
 
## Dependencies 

Must be a direct partner or indirect provider. Indirect resellers cannot access the Partner Center API.
